description: >
  Fantasy baseball roster review for Yahoo fantasy baseball teams. Produces an actionable report:
  category scoreboard vs. opponent, start/sit lineup moves (with slot positions), and add/drop
  targets. By default, the daily review may auto-run start/bench lineup moves, but add/drop
  transactions stay recommendation-only unless explicitly enabled.

  Use this skill whenever the user asks for: fantasy roster review, daily fantasy review,
  roster review, fantasy check,
  start/sit advice, lineup moves, waiver wire targets, fantasy baseball status, or anything
  resembling "check my fantasy teams." Trigger on phrases like "check my teams", "fantasy review",
  "how are my teams doing", "who should I start", "any add/drops", "daily fantasy", or
  "run the roster review".

  Also covers weekly management post-mortems and in-week comeback assessments. Trigger on phrases
  like "weekly review", "how did I manage this week", "grade my week", "review my moves this week",
  or "can I still win this week".

# Fantasy Baseball

This skill is the top-level router for the repo's Yahoo fantasy baseball review workflows.
Keep the public trigger surface stable here, and move the detailed procedure for each workflow
into a dedicated tool reference so we can add more tools over time without bloating this file.

Read `references/tool-notes.md` before calling any Yahoo tools.

## Available Tools

### `daily-roster-review`

Use this tool for the current day-to-day roster review flow:
- matchup scoreboard vs opponent
- opponent pressure check
- start/sit recommendations with exact slot changes
- add/drop targets and streamer ideas
- start/bench execution delegated to `roster-start-bench` by default; add/drop stays manual by default

When the user asks for fantasy roster review, daily fantasy review, start/sit help, lineup moves,
waiver targets, or general team-status advice, load `references/daily-roster-review.md` and follow
that workflow.

### `weekly-review`

Use this tool for a management post-mortem on the current or a just-finished scoring week:
- category outcome vs. opponent, including in-progress weeks
- move-by-move timeline of adds/drops/lineup calls, graded on process vs. result
- opponent management comparison (lineup cleanliness, streamer usage, add/drop efficiency)
- missed opportunities (IL/NA misuse, unused streams, missed saves chases)
- for an in-progress week that is currently being lost: whether a realistic comeback is still
  possible with the best plausible management from here, not hindsight luck
- a scorecard grading category strategy, adds/drops, daily lineup handling, and IL/NA management

When the user asks for a weekly review, a post-mortem on roster moves, "how did I manage this
week", "grade my week", or whether they can still win a losing week, load
`references/weekly-review.md` and follow that workflow.

### `roster-start-bench`

Use this tool when the user explicitly wants browser-driven Yahoo lineup slot management:
- move a player between active lineup slots and `BN`
- activate or bench pitchers and hitters with exact slot swaps
- inspect the current Yahoo page state before or after a manual click sequence
- produce a manual browser checklist when write execution should stay user-driven

This is a shared tool with surface-specific sections. The `Codex` section uses the Codex Browser
plugin's in-app browser, while the `Claude` section drives the user's real Chrome through the
`claude-in-chrome` MCP tools. Do not use it for generic browser automation or API-only roster
advice. When triggered, load `references/roster-start-bench.md` and follow the section that matches
the active surface.

## Operating Rules

- In `daily-roster-review`, default to `autoStartBench=true` and `autoAddDrop=false` unless the
  caller explicitly overrides them.
- For real Yahoo UI lineup changes, prefer the dedicated roster start/bench tool instead of improvising a
  browser procedure inside the review workflows.
- Run multiple user teams sequentially to avoid rate-limiting external baseball data sources.
- Keep reports scannable: strategy first, then scoreboard, then moves, then add/drop targets.
- Every non-trivial recommendation needs a brief `Why` plus a compact `Evidence` table.
- If a deeper check reverses an earlier call, label it clearly as a `Phase 2 reversal`.
- Never hardcode or publish a user's personal league key, team key, or team name.

## Maintenance Notes

- Add future workflows as sibling reference files under `references/` and list them in `Available Tools`.
- Keep this `SKILL.md` focused on trigger coverage, routing, and shared guardrails.
- Put long workflow details in dedicated reference files so the skill stays small and extensible.
